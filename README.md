## TabBot

TabBot is a simple Chrome Extension which monitors a webpage from your browser and alerts you when a particular element on the page comes into existence.

I got the idea while hunting for an Xbox Series X during the holidays; I was refreshing my tabs every few minutes hoping to finally see that magic "Buy Now" button and thought: there must be a better way. I created TabBot and, within 24 hours, was able to purchase one after being alerted a payment button finally appeared on the page. TabBot gives you peace of mind and allows you to do better things with your time than refreshing the same dozen pages over and over again. Simply leave TabBot running in the background and let it work like a fishing pole.

Supporting this page helps me grow TabBot. Right now it only monitors a range of websites for PS5 and Series X availability as a proof of concept, but I hope to allow users to customize and extend TabBot to monitor any webpage looking for any element on the page. This will allow users to monitor many different products easily and safely from their own browser.
