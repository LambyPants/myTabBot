## TabBot

TabBot is a simple Chrome Extension which monitors webpages from your browser and alerts you when a selected element on the page changes.

I got the idea while hunting for an Xbox Series X during the holidays; I was refreshing my tabs every few minutes hoping to finally see that magic "Buy Now" button and thought: there must be a better way. I created TabBot and, within 24 hours, was able to purchase one after being alerted a payment button finally appeared on the page. TabBot gives you peace of mind and allows you to do better things with your time than refreshing the same dozen pages over and over again. Simply leave TabBot running in the background and let it work like a fishing pole.

While there are other product monitors out there, they often require you to pay expensive membership fees or surrender reams of personal information to use. TabBot runs in your own browser and requires zero exchanges of data outside your local browser.

My goal is keep this app as open and accessible as possible and save my users time and stress; no one likes to endlessly manually refresh a page.
